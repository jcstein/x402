# x402

Pay for [Celestia](https://celestia.org) blobs on **Mocha testnet** using stablecoins on **Solana** and **Base** testnet.

The name comes from [HTTP 402: Payment Required](https://http.cat/status/402) — the status code that was always meant for micropayments on the web, and now it's finally getting its moment.

## What is it?

x402 lets you use stablecoins (USDC, etc.) on Solana and Base testnet to pay for blob data posted to Celestia's mocha testnet. No native TIA required for testing — just stablecoins you already have on EVM or Solana.
